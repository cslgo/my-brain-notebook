```shell
## Commit the staged snapshot. This will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message. After youâ€™ve entered a message, save the file and close the editor to create the actual commit.
git commit

## Commit a snapshot of all changes in the working directory. This only includes modifications to tracked files (those that have been added with git add at some point in their history).
git commit -a

## A shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commit message. By default, git commit will open up the locally configured text editor, and prompt for a commit message to be entered. Passing the -m option will forgo the text editor prompt in-favor of an inline message.
git commit -m "some commits"

## A power user shortcut command that combines the -a and -m options. This combination immediately creates a commit of all the staged changes and takes an inline commit message.
git commit -am "commit message"

## This option adds another level of functionality to the commit command. Passing this option will modify the last commit. Instead of creating a new commit, staged changes will be added to the previous commit. This command will open up the system's configured text editor and prompt to change the previously specified commit message.
git commit --amend "update pre commits"


git commit --amend --no-edit
